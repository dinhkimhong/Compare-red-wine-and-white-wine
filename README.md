Compare red wine and white wine by measurements of features from physicochemical tests

I don't drink wine so in this analysis, I would like to figure out the difference between red wine and white wine by visualizations and I also want to see the contribution of features (alcohol, sulphates, density, fixed acidity...) to wine quality.
